# System Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the Distributed Payment System, explaining its components, interactions, and design decisions.

## High-Level Architecture

The Distributed Payment System is built using a microservices architecture pattern, enabling scalability, resilience, and independent development of various system components. Each service is responsible for a specific domain function and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

## Core Components

### API Gateway

- Entry point for all client requests
- Handles routing, authentication, and rate limiting
- Provides a unified API for all services
- Implements circuit breaker patterns
- Technologies: FastAPI

### Authentication Service

- Manages user identity and security
- Handles registration, login, and token validation
- Stores user credentials and profiles
- Issues JWT tokens for authenticated sessions
- Technologies: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, JWT

### Account Service

- Manages user accounts and balances
- Handles account creation, updates, and queries
- Maintains account balances and histories
- Enforces account-level validations and rules
- Technologies: FastAPI, PostgreSQL

### Transaction Service

- Core service for processing financial transactions
- Implements distributed transaction processing with consensus
- Ensures ACID properties for financial operations
- Handles transaction states and lifecycle
- Technologies: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Kafka

### Payment Service

- Simplified interface for payment operations
- Coordinates with Transaction Service for payment processing
- Provides payment-specific validations and workflows
- Technologies: FastAPI, PostgreSQL, Kafka

### Notification Service

- Handles event-based notifications
- Sends emails, SMS, and push notifications
- Provides delivery guarantees and retry mechanisms
- Technologies: FastAPI, Kafka, Redis

### Ledger Service

- Maintains the financial ledger for the system
- Provides accounting and reconciliation features
- Ensures consistency with transaction records
- Technologies: FastAPI, PostgreSQL

## Data Storage

The system uses multiple storage solutions optimized for different purposes:

### PostgreSQL

- Primary relational database for persistent data
- Stores user accounts, transactions, and financial records
- Provides ACID guarantees for critical financial data
- Implemented with sharding for horizontal scaling

### Redis

- Used for caching and temporary data storage
- Stores session information and rate limiting data
- Provides pub/sub capabilities for real-time features
- Improves system performance by reducing database load

### Kafka

- Event streaming platform for asynchronous communication
- Enables event-driven architecture between services
- Provides reliable message delivery with persistence
- Used for transaction event processing and notifications

## Distributed Processing

### Consensus Algorithm

The system implements a custom consensus algorithm for distributed transaction processing:

1. **Preparation Phase**:
   - Transaction request validated by API Gateway
   - Transaction Service creates a transaction record in "pending" state
   - Source and destination accounts are locked with optimistic locking

2. **Validation Phase**:
   - Multiple nodes validate the transaction independently
   - Each node checks for sufficient funds, fraud signals, and compliance
   - Validation results are collected and consensus is reached

3. **Execution Phase**:
   - If consensus approves the transaction, it's executed atomically
   - Account balances are updated
   - Transaction status changes to "completed"
   - Event is published to notify downstream services

4. **Rollback Mechanism**:
   - If consensus rejects the transaction or execution fails
   - All locks are released and accounts returned to previous state
   - Transaction status changes to "failed" with reason

### Fault Tolerance

The system is designed to be resilient against various failure scenarios:

- **Node Failures**: The distributed architecture allows the system to continue operating even if some nodes fail
- **Network Partitions**: The consensus algorithm handles network partitions gracefully
- **Data Consistency**: Strong consistency guarantees for financial data with eventual consistency for non-critical data
- **Automatic Recovery**: Self-healing mechanisms to recover from failures

## Security Architecture

### Authentication and Authorization

- JWT-based authentication with refresh token rotation
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for authorization
- API Gateway enforces authentication and authorization rules
- Regular token rotation and expiration

### Data Protection

- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- TLS for all network communication
- PII data isolation and protection
- Compliance with financial data regulations

### Fraud Detection

- Real-time transaction monitoring
- AI-based anomaly detection
- Rule-based transaction approval
- Integration with external fraud detection services

## Scalability Design

### Horizontal Scaling

- Stateless services that can scale horizontally
- Database sharding for transaction data
- Kubernetes-based auto-scaling based on load

### Performance Optimization

- Caching strategies using Redis
- Asynchronous processing for non-critical operations
- Database query optimization
- Read replicas for read-heavy operations

## Deployment Architecture

### Kubernetes-Based Deployment

- Containerized microservices deployed on Kubernetes
- Service mesh for advanced networking features
- Helm charts for deployment configuration
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for reproducible deployments

### CI/CD Pipeline

- Automated testing and deployment
- Blue-green deployment strategy
- Canary releases for risk mitigation
- Automated rollbacks for failed deployments

## Monitoring and Observability

### Logging and Metrics

- Centralized logging with ELK stack
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- Custom alerts for system health

### Distributed Tracing

- Distributed request tracing across services
- Performance monitoring and bottleneck identification
- Error correlation and root cause analysis

## Future Architecture Evolution

- AI-driven fraud detection enhancements
- Blockchain integration for selected use cases
- Enhanced global distribution and data localization
- Support for central bank digital currencies (CBDCs)
