# Distributed Payment System

## Overview
This project implements a distributed payment system that allows for secure and fault-tolerant payment processing across multiple nodes. The system is designed to handle high transaction volumes while maintaining consistency and availability.

## Features
- Distributed transaction processing
- Fault tolerance with replication
- Consistent hashing for load balancing
- RESTful API for payment operations
- Transaction logging and monitoring
- User authentication and authorization
- Account management
- Payment history tracking

## Architecture
The system follows a microservice architecture with the following components:
- **API Gateway**: Entry point for all requests
- **Auth Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization
- **Account Service**: Manages user accounts and balances
- **Transaction Service**: Processes payment transactions
- **Notification Service**: Sends notifications for completed transactions

## Technologies
- **Backend**: Python with FastAPI
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL for persistent data, Redis for caching
- **Message Queue**: Kafka for asynchronous processing
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes for container orchestration
- **Service Mesh**: Istio for advanced networking features
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana

## Setup and Installation
See the installation guide in the `docs` directory.

## API Documentation
API documentation is available at `/docs` when the server is running, powered by Swagger UI integrated with FastAPI.

## Development
Instructions for local development setup are available in the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file.
